# Process and Thread Management
>This work aims to address the relevant aspects of process management implementation, namely process support, tasks, scheduling, 
synchronism (with traffic lights and condition variables) and the shared memory communication mechanism between processes in a computer.
	To explore memory management implementation aspects, namely main memory support and virtual memory.
	And finally, learn how to implement data storage management, namely file support, file access, file systems and data input and output.
